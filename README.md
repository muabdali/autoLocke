# autoLocke

This is a desktop application built in Python that is meant to assist with
nuzlocke runs.

The application is currently in **Beta**, and supports auto tracking Pokemon captures
in the route they were found in by using Tesseract-OCR to analyze cut-out screenshots of the
user's screen.

The plan is to make an application that is a AIO tool that tracks deaths, levels, IVs etc.

However, the current version is a proof of concept of the program's OCR and tracking system.

# Compatability/Software Requirements


Only tested on Windows 10 (Support for Linux and MacOS is coming)


Tested on DeSuMe and GBA (although other emulators will probably work)


Only support for Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Saphire and Fire Red, Leaf Green

# Hardware Requirements

## Minimum Requirements

CPU -  INTEL PENTIUM 4 

GPU - Integrated graphics

RAM - 4GB 



# Setup

When opening up the application, the user is prompted with
a visual tutorial on how to properly setup the application.

This is necessary to prevent any obstruction of the autoLocke's 
processing system.

The instructions are as follows:

Step 1: Maximize the emulator window.

Step 2: Anchor autoLocke to the top right of your screen.

Step 3: Select game version. As of writing this, the only available
games are Fire Red and Emerald. Other versions of Gen 1 and 3 may work,
however they have not been tested.

Step 4: Play as usual.

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Speeding up the emulator should work fine, however anything higher than 8x speed 
is buggy and not 100% reliable.
