# DEPRECIATED, MAY NO LONGER WORK

# autoLocke

This is a desktop application built in Python that is meant to assist with
nuzlocke runs.

The application is currently in **Beta**, and supports auto tracking Pokemon captures
in the route they were found in by using Tesseract-OCR to analyze cut-out screenshots of the
user's screen.

The plan is to make an application that is a AIO tool that tracks deaths, levels, IVs etc.

However, the current version is a proof of concept of the program's OCR and tracking system.
